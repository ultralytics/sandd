# üìú Description

The [Ultralytics WAVE repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/wave) offers a novel approach to particle physics detector readout and reconstruction through **WA**veform **V**ector **E**xploitation. By utilizing advanced ML and DNN techniques, WAVE aims to improve the precision and efficiency of interpreting complex waveform data from Time-Of-Flight detectors, contributing to advancements in [AI research](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/the-role-of-deep-research-models-in-ai-advancements).

# üì¶ Requirements

To get started with WAVE, you'll need [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.7 or newer. The necessary libraries can be easily installed using `pip` and the provided `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip3 install -U -r requirements.txt
```

Key package requirements include:

- `numpy`: Fundamental package for numerical computation.
- `scipy`: Used for scientific and technical computing tasks.
- `torch` (version 0.4.0+): An open-source ML framework for building and training neural networks.
- `tensorflow` (version 1.8.0+): A comprehensive ecosystem for ML, offering tools, libraries, and community resources.
- `plotly` (optional): For creating interactive data visualizations.

You can find more information about these tools on their respective websites: [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [SciPy](https://scipy.org/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/).

# üöÄ Running the Code

Several scripts are available to execute the WAVE models:

- **PyTorch Implementation**: Use `wave_pytorch.py` for models developed with the PyTorch framework.
- **TensorFlow Implementation**: Run `wave_tf.py` for models based on TensorFlow.
- **PyTorch on Google Cloud Platform**: Deploy `wave_pytorch_gcp.py` for running PyTorch models within the [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/) environment.

# ‚ú® Visualizations

Here are some example visualizations showcasing waveforms processed by WAVE and the training progress of the models:
