# üéâ Introduction

This directory is part of the innovative work developed by Ultralytics and **is available for use and redistribution under the AGPL-3.0 license**. For an insightful overview of our diverse projects, we invite you to visit [Ultralytics](https://www.ultralytics.com).


# üìú Description

The [Ultralytics WAVE repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/wave) offers leading-edge **WA**veform **V**ector **E**xploitation code. This novel approach to particle physics detector readout and reconstruction leverages Machine Learning and Deep Neural Networks to enhance data analysis and interpretation.

# üì¶ Requirements

To dive into WAVE, ensure you have Python 3.7 or newer. Necessary libraries can be installed via `pip` using the provided `requirements.txt` with the following command:

```bash
pip3 install -U -r requirements.txt
```
The essential packages required are:
- `numpy`: For numerical computing.
- `scipy`: For scientific and technical computing.
- `torch` (version 0.4.0 or higher): For constructing and training neural networks.
- `tensorflow` (version 1.8.0 or higher): Provides a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources.
- `plotly`: Optional for creating interactive plots.

# üöÄ Running

To execute WAVE models, you have several scripts at your disposal:

- **PyTorch Implementation**: Utilize `wave_pytorch.py` for models based on the PyTorch framework.
- **TensorFlow Implementation**: Call upon `wave_tf.py` for TensorFlow-based models.
- **PyTorch on Google Cloud Platform**: Deploy `wave_pytorch_gcp.py` within the Google Cloud Platform ecosystem.
