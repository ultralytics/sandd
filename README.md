# Project Description üåê

The [WAVE repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/wave) houses our state-of-the-art **WA**veform **V**ector **E**xploitation code, which is revolutionizing the way we perform readout and reconstruction in particle physics detectors. Leveraging Machine Learning and advanced Deep Neural Networks, WAVE aims to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of physical data analysis. This project showcases an innovative approach to processing time-of-flight detector signals for particle identification and event reconstruction.

# Prerequisites and Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed on your system. To get started with WAVE, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip3 install -U -r requirements.txt
```

Key packages include:
- `numpy`: For numerical computing and array operations.
- `scipy`: For scientific and technical computing.
- `torch` >= 0.4.0: For tensor computation and neural network modeling with GPU acceleration.
- `tensorflow` >= 1.8.0: For dataflow and differentiable programming across a range of tasks.
- `plotly` (optional): For interactive graphing.

# How to Run the Code üî®

To explore WAVE, you can run the following scripts:
- PyTorch implementation of WAVE: `wave_pytorch.py`
- TensorFlow implementation of WAVE: `wave_tf.py`
- PyTorch WAVE on Google Cloud Platform: `gcp/wave_pytorch_gcp.py`

Here are some sample waveform data visualizations generated by the scripts:
